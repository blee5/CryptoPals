# AES in ECB mode

The Base64-encoded content [in this file](input.txt) has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key
`"YELLOW SUBMARINE".`
(case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).

Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.
